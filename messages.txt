Hobbies:

Bowling:

I have been practicing bowling for about 6 months now, and I enjoy playing in my spare time. I usually make it to the alley once or twice a week, and am competing in a league! My current top score is 228.

Technology:

I love technology. Anything from cars to electronics to robotics to aeronautics, I love learning about, building, repairing, and breaking technology. I have taken apart things to learn about them for as long as I can remember, and I am always excited to learn more about everything that drives technology in our world.

Long Range Shooting:

In 2019 I custom built my own AR-10 chambered in 6.5 creedmor. I am working on getting my groupings smaller and smaller. I have theoretical knowledge of shooting, but have never actually shot past about 400 yards. I am excited to spend more time learning and actually shooting in the future.

Military Vehicles:

I love learning about military vehicles. I know most about tanks and armor from WW2, but love learning about any type of vehicle. I have built scale models of vehicles for about 10 years now, and enjoy working on them in free time.

Airsoft:

This is probably my most recent hobby. Airsoft is fun with a group of friends, and it's fun to build and mod airsoft rifles. I'm still learning about it, and die more often then not, but I have a lot of fun!
