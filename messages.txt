Hobbies:

Bowling:

I have been practicing bowling for about 6 months now, and I enjoy playing in my spare time. I usually make it to the alley once or twice a week, and am competing in a league! My current top score is 228.

Technology:

I love technology. Anything from cars to electronics to robotics to aeronautics, I love learning about, building, repairing, and breaking technology. I have taken apart things to learn about them for as long as I can remember, and I am always excited to learn more about everything that drives technology in our world.

Long Range Shooting:

In 2019 I custom built my own AR-10 chambered in 6.5 creedmor. I am working on getting my groupings smaller and smaller. I have theoretical knowledge of shooting, but have never actually shot past about 400 yards. I am excited to spend more time learning and actually shooting in the future.

Military Vehicles:

I love learning about military vehicles. I know most about tanks and armor from WW2, but love learning about any type of vehicle. I have built scale models of vehicles for about 10 years now, and enjoy working on them in free time.

Airsoft:

This is probably my most recent hobby. Airsoft is fun with a group of friends, and it's fun to build and mod airsoft rifles. I'm still learning about it, and die more often then not, but I have a lot of fun!



Career:

Where I've Been

I started working with computers at about the age of 12, when my Dad got me interested in programming with Python. I've loved working with computers ever since. 
In High School I competed in the VEX Robotics competition, and actually made it to Nationals. We weren't able to go because of COVID. 
During High School I also attended Bridgerland Technical College, and earned a 900 hour certificate in Information Technology. 
Along the way I completed the CompTIA A+, Network+, and Security+ certificates. 
I have also completed several other certificates including Splunk's Certified Power User, HAM Radio technician class license, Microsoft Office 2016 Suite certified user, and several Testout certifications.
I attended my first Cybersecurity competition in my Junior year of High School and since have competed in about 10 different competitions.
My latest competition was in April of 2023. My team at SUU made it to nationals! We will be going to Chicago in September to compete in the National competition.

Where I Am

Right now I am attending Southern Utah University studying Cybersecurity. I have about 2 years until I graduate. I currently work at Hill Air Force Base for the Air Force as a Cybersecurity intern. 
I am enjoying serving my country as a civilian and being able to put my skills to good use. I am also slowly but surely studying for the OSCP certificate, and I hope to get that before I graduate.

Where I'm going

My projected graduation date is in Spring of 2025! After that I plan on jumping right in to the Cybersecurity field. I have a dream of joining the NSA, FBI, or CIA. I have also thought about working on similar projects
to what I'm doing right now at HAFB. I've always loved tanks, and I would love to work on the M1 Abrams project.
